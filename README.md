# Just Notes
_Will Koenig_

## Description
This is a full stack note-taking application that I developed using `JavaScript` as well as the following libraries
* `Node.js` to build a backend that can manage a DB connection and host APIs 
* `React` to create a dynamic frontend
* `Express.js` to develop API's for my frontend to interact with my backend
* `MongoDB` and `Mongoose` to handle interactions between my frontend and backend 

## Download & Run Instructions
If you are interested in downloading and running this project then you can follow these instructions; before I begin I am assuming that you have both Node installed, if not you can find a helpful guide [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
1. Once you have the project downloaded you are going to need to navigate to the directory
```bash
cd path/to/downloaded/project
```

2. Install the necessary packages to run the project using
```bash
npm install
```
or if you are using yarn instead of npm
```bash
yarn install
```

3. At this point you are ready to run the application using
```bash
npm start
```
or if you are using yarn
```bash
yarn start
```
